# Exercise 2: Create a Teams app from a sample in the gallery

Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code provides a collection of samples that are ready for you to explore and create your base app from. In this exercise, you'll create your first Microsoft Teams app from the Samples gallery.

## Task 1: Create an app from a sample

1. In Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code, select **View Samples** to view a catalog of sample apps.

2. Find a sample that interests you and select the screenshot to open the page for that sample.  In order to get up and running quickly, select a sample that lists "Ready for debug" under the sample title on the sample's detail page.  (Other samples will list "Manual configurations required").
3. On the sample page, select **Create** and choose a folder for saving your project. The project will be scaffolded in this local folder.

4. When the scaffolding is done, you'll see a new Visual Studio Code window with the Hello World Bot project loaded.  After the project has been scaffolded, you might get a message from Visual Studio Code that asks if you trust the authors of the files in this folder. Select the **Yes, I trust the authors** button to continue.

5. Now you can view the project code, which includes:

- The Teams app code.
- Deployment and manifest files inside the appPackage folder.
- Environment variables inside the env folder.
- A README file that provides required steps to run, debug, and deploy the app.
