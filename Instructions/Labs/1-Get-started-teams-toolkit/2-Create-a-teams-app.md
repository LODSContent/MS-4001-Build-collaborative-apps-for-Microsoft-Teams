# Exercise 2: Create a Teams app from a sample in the gallery

Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code provides a collection of samples that are ready for you to explore and create your base app from. In this exercise, you'll create your first Microsoft Teams app from the Samples gallery.

Follow one of the tasks below to create a Teams app from a sample or to create a new Teams app using Teams Toolkit.

## Task 1: Create a new Teams app

You may also create a new Teams app using Teams Toolkit.

1. In Teams Toolkit, select **Create a New App**.
2. On the New Project menu, select** **Tab**.
3. When prompted to select a capability, select **Basic Tab**.
4. When prompted to select a programming language, select **TypeScript**.
5. When prompted to select a folder, select **Default folder** or choose a different file location.
6. **Enter an application name** of your choice for your basic tab app and select **enter**.
7. Teams Toolkit will scaffold a new app and open the project folder in Visual Studio Code.
8. You may receive a message from Visual Studio Code that asks if you trust the authors of the files in this folder. Select the **Yes, I trust the authors** button to continue.
9. Now you can view the project code, which includes:

- The Teams app code.
- Deployment and manifest files inside the appPackage folder.
- Environment variables inside the env folder.
